## Installation

Before running the project, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Since Node.js dependencies are excluded via `.gitignore`, you'll need to install them separately.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
2. Install Node.js dependencies: npm install
